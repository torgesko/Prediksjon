		 * This implementation only computes the distance if it's less than or
		 * equal to the threshold value, returning -1 if it's greater. The
		 * advantage is performance: unbounded distance is O(nm), but a bound of
		 * k allows us to reduce it to O(km) time by only computing a diagonal
		 * stripe of width 2k + 1 of the cost table. It is also possible to use
		 * this to compute the unbounded Levenshtein distance by starting the
		 * threshold at 1 and doubling each time until the distance is found;
		 * this is O(dm), where d is the distance.
		 *
		 * One subtlety comes from needing to ignore entries on the border of
		 * our stripe eg. p[] = |#|#|#|* d[] = *|#|#|#| We must ignore the entry
		 * to the left of the leftmost member We must ignore the entry above the
		 * rightmost member
		 *
		 * Another subtlety comes from our stripe running off the matrix if the
		 * strings aren't of the same size. Since string s is always swapped to
		 * be the shorter of the two, the stripe will always run off to the
		 * upper right instead of the lower left of the matrix.
		 *
		 * As a concrete example, suppose s is of length 5, t is of length 7,
		 * and our threshold is 1. In this case we're going to walk a stripe of
		 * length 3. The matrix would look like so:
		 *
		 * <pre>
		 *    1 2 3 4 5
		 * 1 |#|#| | | |
		 * 2 |#|#|#| | |
		 * 3 | |#|#|#| |
		 * 4 | | |#|#|#|
		 * 5 | | | |#|#|
		 * 6 | | | | |#|
		 * 7 | | | | | |
		 * </pre>
		 *
		 * Note how the stripe leads off the table as there is no possible way
		 * to turn a string of length 5 into one of length 7 in edit distance of
		 * 1.
		 *
		 * Additionally, this implementation decreases memory usage by using two
		 * single-dimensional arrays and swapping them back and forth instead of
		 * allocating an entire n by m matrix. This requires a few minor
		 * changes, such as immediately returning when it's detected that the
		 * stripe has run off the matrix and initially filling the arrays with
		 * large values so that entries we don't compute are ignored.
		 *
		 * See Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences by Dan Gusfield for
		 * some discussion.
